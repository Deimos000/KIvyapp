Apreciate Help 
The Problem is as Stated on StackOverflow i cant call the function(Allgemeinpunkte)
wich works normaly(after the form has loaded and i press a button for example)
however wanting to call it during the start up i get:  'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get_screen' 
couldnt find anything that would help 


All the files are just files where i sore the values to graph therefore for testing only Allgemein.txt is needed (if all is supposed to work all files are requiered)
